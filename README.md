## Advanced technician's certificate
You will find the documentations I wrote for my advanced technician's certificate.
They are about projects I managed and succeded during these 2 years.
All documentations are in French but a module will be added to translate them on [my personnal website](https://portfolio.baptistegrimaldi.info/)
